Goals:
    Use HTTP POST
    Maintain complex session state over multiple requests
    Learn how to the end the HTTP session

Requirements:
    Create a Heads-Tails coin flip game 
    The game state should be managed by a game model object in the HTTP session
    The game page should 
        Display the current score (number of games played an win percentage) 
    Display some information about the last flip, if any
    Present the user with a the option to guess HEADS or TAILS or to end the game
    A HEADS or TAILS choice should POST to the game servlet and update the game state 
        Use the redirect after POST pattern
    If the user ends the game, display and end game page with
        The final score
        An option to start over (reset the HTTP session)

Bonus:
    Students seeking a little more challenge are encourage to substitute a slightly more advanced game of chance like 
    Rock/Paper/Scissors (Lizard/Spock) that requires the user to select between a finite number of choices.
